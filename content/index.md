# home

my name is nicole and i am a math student at yale university. 

i am interested in adversarial machine learning, privacy, and security. i also enjoy bayesian and probabilistic machine learning.

i started my internet journey making html layouts for an online horse game before abandoning my web dev dreams. after a decade of instagram, i moved to a very beige github page and microblogged unsuccessfully before building a fish-themed website that revealed too much about me. after being too embarrassed to ever share it, i abandoned css and arrived here.
