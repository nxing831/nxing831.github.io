# home

my name is nicole and i am a math student at yale university. 

i am interested in ai security and privacy. 

i started my internet journey making html layouts for an online horse game before abandoning my web dev dreams. after a decade of instagram, i moved to a very beige github page and microblogged unsuccessfully before building a beautiful website that broke on any device other than my own. after being too embarrassed to ever share it, i renounced css and arrived here.
