# academics, about, a bit

i did my undergraduate degree in mathematics. i am kind of writing a thesis.

previously, i did research in a variety of buildings in other places.

i am taking a 2026 gap and intend to apply to phd programs in statistics and computer science after. roughly speaking, i am interested in ai security; this involves privacy, secure computing, adversarial machine learning, and alignment. 

i also enjoy statistical learning theory, deep learning, etc. recently i have gone down a rabbithole on bayesian learning methods. i am also entertaining random processes and stochastic control.
