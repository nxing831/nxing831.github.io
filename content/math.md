# academics, a bit

i am finishing my undergraduate degree in mathematics. currently, i am beginning my thesis in error correcting codes.

previously, i did machine learning research with organizations of varying size. if you ask nicely, i might tell you where.

i am taking a 2026 gap and intend to apply to phd programs in statistics and computer science after. roughly speaking, i am interested in ai security, especially with applications from pozk, adversarial methods, and probabilistic machine learning. this is broad and i intend to narrow it down... eventually
