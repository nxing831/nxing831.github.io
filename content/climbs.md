# climbing log

logging training, sends, and climbs i've set (the job of putting climbs up, typically in commercial gyms)

started climbing in summer 2023, tore my tfcc spring 2025, off for rehab and mostly setting since.

## dec 2025
incredibly injured, shoulder impingement seems to be getting worse and worse but wrist is doing alright. busy with finals and back home, so no setting

yoga is fun! lots to practice--trying to transition off assisted chin stand + generally working on arm balances. and of course basics could always improve... excited for jan 2026, starting ashtanga practice then. 

12/15 -- i got my flying splits!!

12/20 -- working on astavakrana, unfortunately getting my butt kicked. lots of wrist tightness from tfcc

12/24 -- probably overdid it on the arm balances. struggling with lots of wrist tightness and continued shoulder instability. PT for early january scheduled. 

## nov 2025

### climbing

continuing to fight shoulder pain and wrist instability (tore tfcc in march 2025). off climbing and only doing yoga this month.

pretty much never did yoga until this month but loving it + having lots of fun doing inversions. working on basic arm inversions. obv have much to work on but can feel the benefits already. shoulder is super messed up though, can't do one-handed stuff with right arm usually. 

### setting

**"prematurely air conditioned supermarket" v3+:** both hands undercling start, right foot up, right hand up to crimp on right side chimney, high left foot above start hold, kneebar into the chimney, stem upwards with left hand, right hand cross over, left hand out, match, lh out, straightforward around the corner to finish. 

i think this should be fun for beginners learning new movements. proud of how it turned out, despite half the boltholes being stripped (again) + me sucking at setting chimney or vert climbs.

**"my first time upside down" v2:** start both hands on crimpy sidepull, flag foot to start. shuffle right hand to another side pull, switch feet, bump right to crimp, lh. high-ish left foot cross, lh to roof jug, rh to roof jug, straightforward finish. a shorter climb than i wanted, but didn't have great ideas for a low wall that was basically vert. 

this was intended as a beginner climber's intro to steeper angles without doing a full roof climb. i honestly thought it was more of a v1, but some people struggled when i asked them to run it.

## oct 2025

### climbing

tore my rotator cuff, off most of this month

### setting

**"46 inch citation drum" v2/3:** start both hands pinching a sidepull, right hand cross, left hand out. heel on start pinch, right hand bump, left up, right cross vertical. undercling ending. 

this was fun and fast. i think it has a really nice variety of movement for beginners.

**"drop in, smack the lip..." v2:** start both hands on a juggy sidepull, rh / lh pulling inwards, toe start hold, big deadpoint to fat jug, match, feet up, finish. 

this climb was frustrating to put up. the wall is quite small and many of the boltholes have been stripped, so not a lot of variety. the big deadpoint also happened because i forgot to put up a foothold; when i came back to downgrade the climb, people told me to leave it as is...

**"between a wall and a hard place" v0**: jugs straight up, can right foot smear on essentially no-tex gym wall. 

a frustrating set because no wall, holds, or boltholes left.

## feb 2025

### setting

**i forgot the name of this climb tbh v6/7**: both hands, rf out to start. medium-sized left hand bump. hand-foot match and right hand to slippery but decent wooden edge. super messed up next move, lowkey dynamic to positive but slippery pinch. match or straight up to finish. 45 deg wall. 

a fun, burly climb that unfortunately is mostly a one-move wonder and v4/5 everywhere else... my bad. also kind of similar to the bitter 6b+ 2016 moonboard benchmark... my bad.
