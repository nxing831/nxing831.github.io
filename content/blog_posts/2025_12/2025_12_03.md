# the academic website is the closest thing we have left to internet independence: or, is it okay that most of us don't want to code?

*this post is evolving and occasionally updated/edited.*

*I do not personally endorse the claims, opinions, language, or content available on anything linked on my site; this is purely for information-and-or-joy-sharing purposes.*

If you're interested in mathematics or its many related fields, you've probably come across The Academic Homepage. On these personal sites, PhD students, postdocs, and professors list––often with distressing inconsistency––links to CVs, papers published, courses taught, and research group descriptions. Maybe you've seen one of [these](https://jekyll-themes.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) Jekyll themes, which are popular due to their integration with GitHub Pages. Or maybe you've visited Terence Tao's famous and richly informative [Wordpress blog](https://terrytao.wordpress.com). But my favorite academic websurfing experience is encountering content that's more personal, opinionated, or downright wild. 

Many of my mathematically involved friends relish in the same hobby, and it seems that the online community [does, too](https://www.reddit.com/r/math/comments/hrbnzn/fun_mathematics_professor_websites/). It's nice to see your often-terrifying professors humanized by webpages that have more than a CV. Some of my favorite websites include [Bozho's incredibly designed php site](http://theo.inrne.bas.bg/~bozho/index.php); [Professor Zeilberger's extensive css-free list of opinion posts](https://sites.math.rutgers.edu/~zeilberg/OPINIONS.html), which features descriptive titles such as "Opinion 145: The Tail of Statistics, Will (soon) Wag the Dog of Mathematics, and instead of 'Statistics is a Mathematical Science' we would say that 'Mathematics is a Statistical Science'"; [Professor Montgomery's academic page](https://people.ucsc.edu/~rmont/), whose essay about his refusal to close his office window and its eventual breakage at the hands of a SWAT team sent to take over his office and close said window I encourage you to read; and [Professor Schwartz's page](https://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/), whose incredible comic titled ["It's fun to pee"](https://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/ComixFun/index.html), as well as [whatever this incredible work of art is, in complete seriousness](https://www.math.brown.edu/reschwar/Comix/helix.pdf), should be required viewing. 


I will admit that I glorify the oldweb out of nostalgia. Maybe in an AI doomeristic view, I value features like [webrings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webring) only because they preceded digital algorithms. I realize that, like many of my Gen-Z peers, I'm a strong believer in the enduring beauty of analog technology, and I'm attracted to the physicality of film photography, et cetera et cetera, more by impulse than well-formulated argument (though they exist!). But as I've thought more about the Internet, I've come to feel strongly about the importance of engaging with digital history and culture. It's worth understanding the decline in personal webpages as part of a convergence to enclosed computer and software design. This in itself is not a revelatory observation. Still, when we think about our loss of autonomy on digital platforms and its increasingly material consequences, it's important to contextualize it in the genesis of the Internet and the kind of behaviors it has always encouraged.

We can argue ourselves inside and out about who tightened the leash on Internet existence: individuals or the dot com empire, or something more insidious, or whether the dot com empire itself is simply a reflection of individual greed and capitalistic desire (\hj), or any other permutation of concerns. The point is, many of us are working with Apple ecosystems, sharing our lives on uniform social platforms, storing information on the same cloud services, and generally dividing our multiplicity of personas across various pre-built applications. This behavior is often advantageous and efficient. It also encourages, in subliminal ways, a relinquishing of control over our internet existences. We dislike how our data is bought and sold; we dislike the ease of LLMs and endless automatic video recommendations. We like the internet and the freedoms it seems to represent. And yet many of us do not want to code. What do we desire out of the Internet, and what sorts of bargains do we have to make with it?

Here are some scattered thoughts about my love for it all: web as infinite and evolving, oldweb as archive, design versus style, the emergence of Internet art, cyberfeminism, and decision in the limit of infinite pleasure. 

## Early Internet and the Prof. Dr. Site
The earliest computers bore little resemblance to modern laptops and were confined to institutions with the necessary knowledge and resources, chiefly militaries and governments. In the next stage, primitive personal computers functioned only in the hands of dedicated hobbyists who took the time to learn. By the time computers became household staples, they were hardly recognizable: instead of connecting wires and switches, we were clicking colorful icons and navigating premade applications. And this evolution is––supposedly––good. If we accept *a priori* that "democratizing" (sue me) technology is a net good by some agreed-upon metric, ease-of-use should be very high priority. This necessitates huge simplifications that limit what increasingly-unspecialized userbases can break or manipulate. And this is––supposedly––not so good? Today, it's common to complain about "enshittification" (and I would agree), but there's also a strange balance to strike between digital enclosures and the needs of accessible technology. We can observe these conflicting ideas about simplicity in the "Prof. Dr." site.
- *Side note: This whole "if-you-want-it-you're-probably-too-lazy-to-deserve-the-full-thing" schtick also leads us to this entire mess of technocrats or, having just made this term up, technoeugenics, i.e., those who believe they have the right to steer humanity because we're all bashing stones together and their deep knowledge of the inner workings of stones warrants the right to, like, control the stones and the aforementioned bashing and the achievement of global dominance along the way...?*


The first Internet site went live in 1991. The webpages that followed were simple, text-based, and run essentially exclusively by academics, researchers, and government employees. The 1995 rise of graphical browsers and websurfing reshaped most of the then-existing Internet. Today, it is difficult to find sites from 1993-1994 that have maintained their original look. Remarkably, Internet archivist, activist, and artist [Olia Lialina's](https://art.teleportacia.org) method for finding 1993-style sites is simply Googling "Prof. Dr.," leading to the aptly named ["Prof. Dr. Style"](https://contemporary-home-computing.org/prof-dr-style/) for webpages. This is so intuitive but so genius. Of course academic pages have their aesthetic roots in the oldweb––they literally defined the early internet. 

The effectiveness and archival importance of the Prof. Dr. site is ridiculous but charming. In Lialina's words, "Primitivity tells us the story of the browser being not only a browser, but also an editor. **Every user of the early web was a producer of web content** \[...] **Prof. Dr. pages look terribly the same.** As if they were generated automatically by the browser \[...] **Though, ironically, they are among the last pages generated completely by humans**, not content management systems or services." 

I'm fascinated by these threads of convenience, uniformity, design, and humanity. The Prof. Dr. site flourished because of how little you could do with it. They were easy to set up, easy to replicate, and easy to view. Today, I would argue the Prof. Dr. style is one of the most creative and effort-intensive Internet presences one can have. The work it takes to create and publish a personal page is so outsized compared to that of, say, an Instagram profile, that the apparent "sameness" of the Prof. Dr. page now feels deeply compelling and personal. How distressing, how beautiful, how far we've come!

## The Motherfxxking Website 
The Prof. Dr. naturally leads to the philosophy of the [MotherFxxing Website](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com), followed by a chain of other "motherfxxing websites" whose language I do not necessarily endorse: 

- [https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/](https://perfectmotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [https://thebestmotherfucking.website/](https://thebestmotherfucking.website/)
- [http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/](http://bettermotherfuckingwebsite.com/)
- [https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/](https://evenbettermotherfucking.website/)

The MotherFxxking Website is a semi-recent phenomenon, and through it, we can understand how the Internet experience has diverged into two paths: one for creators and one for users. In the Prof. Dr. era, "user" and "creator" were essentially synonymous. Today's Internet surfer has likely never managed or even edited a page on their own. The modern webmaster has to ask what purpose their digital presence serves and whether the external viewer has anything to do with it. If we take the stance of the Motherfxxking Website, then we assume that a proper website is outwards-facing, i.e., something whose primary goal is to be viewed and understood. It makes sense, then, that the "perfect" Motherfxxking Website is lightweight, legible, and accessible. That's where all this "motherfxxking" language comes from: it's the in-your-face all-that-you-need of a website, like it or not. 

I would agree that good communication is often concise. But I'm not sure about the Motherfxxking Website. Especially in the context of the Internet, I find it hard to believe that professionalism and refinement should be the ultimate goals. And though a cumbersome "40-pound jQuery file and 83 polyfills" isn't something we should encourage, I do think that amateurism should be valued and actively embraced. The heavyset garishness of web-learning-by-doing is something that I miss, though I wonder, too, why that really is. Refined websites aren't necessarily restrained. Some of my personal favorites, like [koilwood](https://koilwood.neocities.org), [fileto](https://fileto.neocities.org), and [juneish](https://juneish.neocities.org), are exploding with care and creativity. On sites like those, it's not like I find myself wishing for more. 

I love to put the cluttered 90s disastersite on a pedestal, but I don't want to equate "having a bunch of stuff online" with being genuine (and is being genuine the goal here?). Social media is oversaturated with influencers who literally overshare their overcurated online presence *as a full time job*. Volume of output has nothing to do with its authenticity. Still, so much of my online experience has been about reduction and selection. I have so much to say, and the process of choosing *what* to say is something I do everywhere else in my life. I want the Internet to be the place where I leave it all behind, but it isn't. I resent my own self-censoring and I'm embarrassed to be embarrassed. Plus, there's something spooky about existing openly online now vis-à-vis data and your digital footprint...

## On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog
In 2023, Peter Steiner's 1993 cartoon for *The New Yorker,* titled, "On the Internet, nobody knows you're a dog," [sold for $175,000 at auction.](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/the-most-reprinted-new-yorker-cartoon-breaks-record-at-auction-for-a-single-panel-comic-180983135/) It's sometimes interpreted as the first Internet meme, and many view it as the first major sign of the Internet's public popularity. I'm fascinated by this cartoon and the conversations around Internet anonymity which, apparently, started 30 years ago. I see this thread everywhere: the Dog With A Blog sitcom, for example, or Apple's [Cyberdog](https://oldvcr.blogspot.com/2023/10/teaching-apple-cyberdog-10-new-tricks.html). The comic's title opens Chapter 1 of Marie Meixnerová's *#mm net art: Internet Art in the Virtual and Physical Space of Its Presentation,* in which she details early Internet art digital expression. 

I'm struck, too, by Lialina's 2025 ["On the Internet, everybody knows you had a dog,"](https://ontheinterneteverybodyknows.geocities.institute) which features, among other things, "Web pages of people who also had dogs," "Web pages people made in memory for their dogs," "Web pages made by people to sell dogs to other people," and "Web pages made by dogs." Lialina writes, **"There is no separate category for each dog breed because—despite its name and appearance—this work is not really about dogs. It’s about people who built the web by making pages about the things they loved."** And if that doesn't make you cry a little, I don't know what will. Physical artwork requires an explicit sharing; the webpage is simply lost and found. 

On the Internet in 2025, not only does everyone know you're a dog, but they know your breed, pedigree, history of ownership, diet, walk routine, history of vet visits, what you looked like as a puppy, how you flunked out of police dog school, how you were never satisfied with your chihuahua of a father, how things were never the same after they razed your favorite park in favor of a cat hotel, and how your hip dysplasia is leading slowly but surely to a final day of steak and euthanasia. 

## Infinite Jest and Internet Bargains

David Foster Wallace has a lot to say about––amongst other things––pleasure, addiction, nationalism, and bargains with technology in *Infinite Jest.* Though I have certain gripes with the book, it is one of my favorites and an irreplaceable first-read experience. It was published in 1996 and could equally have been released yesterday or five years in the future. 

Here are two striking excerpts on entertainment culture from Judith Strasser's 1996 interview of DFW (transcript from [here](https://tonyreinke.com/2018/03/05/david-foster-wallace-on-entertainment-culture/)):

"Well, I think the pressures aren’t just on us, but I think they’re on the TV networks, which are businesses in which have found out that entertaining news is vastly more profitable. The reason for that is that we, as an audience of individuals, seem to be voting with our wallets for the entertaining news and that the changes that are going to need to come, I think, are going to need to come in terms of our own individual taste rather than any sort of laws passed on the networks about violence or news content or anything like that. It just, I guess my point is, right now and I think the next 15 or 20 years are going to be a very scary and sort of very exciting time when **we have to sort of reevaluate our relationship to fun and pleasure and entertainment because it’s going to get so good, and so high pressure, that we’re going to have to forge some kind of attitude toward it that lets us live.**"

"\[...] take away the power of people’s choices to make their own decisions and want to make those choices for them. It seems to me that … I mean, I’m not a member of any 12-step program, but the reason why these programs interest me is because they seem to involve people who’ve sort of bottomed out on the great American way of life who are having now to sort of redefine and remake some kind of force that they’re going to give themselves away to. \[...] the scariest thing about our relationship to pleasure and entertainment is that as we get more and more “decadent” and more and more unhappy, I think at a certain point, **we are going to be desperate enough to have other people just tell us what to do**; that \[...] fascism \[...] is going to look viable to a lot of people. I think it’s pretty scary."


I'm hesitant to say much about *Infinite Jest*. It's not possible for me to speak DFW's words for him. But I do want these quotes here. And I want to ask: is digital freedom something we request or demand? Something we shape with our hands? Our wallets? And what are the consequences of not wanting it *enough* to make real changes in our lives and behavior? It seems that we are already finding out.

i want to talk about the dematerialization of art and internet art, features of old websites, digital scarcity, the web as a gallery, cyberfeminism, geocities and neocities, and so much more! to come later...
