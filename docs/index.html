<p>my name is nicole and i am a math student at yale university.</p>
<p>i am interested in statistical and deep learning, especially bayesian learning; ai safety, e.g. privacy, security, policy, alignment; and random processes.</p>
<p>i started my internet journey making html layouts for an online horse game before abandoning my web dev dreams. after a decade of instagram, i moved to a very beige github page and microblogged unsuccessfully before building a fish-themed website that revealed too much about me. after being too embarrassed to ever share it, i abandoned css and arrived here.</p>
