<p>logging training (injuries), sends (recovery), and climbs i’ve set.</p>
<p>started climbing in summer 2023, tore my tfcc spring 2025, off for rehab and mostly setting since.</p>

<p>continuing to fight shoulder pain and wrist instability (tore tfcc in march 2025). off climbing and only doing yoga this month.</p>
<p>pretty much never did yoga until this month but loving it + having lots of fun doing inversions. learned to do crow and side crow in like a week, which i’m proud of! obv have much to work on but can feel the benefits already. shoulder is super messed up though, can’t do one-handed stuff with right arm usually.</p>
<h3 id="setting" tabindex="-1">setting</h3>
<p><strong>“prematurely air conditioned supermarket” v3+:</strong> both hands undercling start, right foot up, right hand up to crimp on right side chimney, high left foot above start hold, kneebar into the chimney, stem upwards with left hand, right hand cross over, left hand out, match, lh out, straightforward around the corner to finish. pretty fun climb and proud of how it turned out, despite half the boltholes being stripped (again), coming in without a plan, and generally being awful at setting in this section of the gym</p>

<p><strong>“my first time upside down” v2:</strong> start both hands on crimpy sidepull, flag foot to start. shuffle right hand to another side pull, switch feet, bump right to crimp, lh. high-ish left foot cross, lh to roof jug, rh to roof jug, straightforward finish. a shorter climb than i wanted, but didn’t have great ideas for a low wall that was basically vert. intended as a first-time cave climbers’ intro to steeper angles (the ending).</p>

<p>tore my rotator cuff, off most of this month</p>
<h3 id="setting-1" tabindex="-1">setting</h3>
<p><strong>“46 inch citation drum” v2/3:</strong> start both hands pinching a sidepull, right hand cross, left hand out. heel on start pinch, right hand bump, left up, right cross vertical. undercling ending. this was fun to set and i think has a good variety of movement for beginners.</p>
<p><img src="/climbing/sets/fall25/drum.jpg" alt="drum"></p>
<p><strong>“drop in, smack the lip…” v2:</strong> start both hands on a juggy sidepull, rh / lh pulling inwards, toe start hold, big deadpoint to fat jug, match, feet up, finish. this climb was frustrating to put up. the wall is quite small and many of the boltholes have been stripped, so not a lot of variety. the big deadpoint also happened because i forgot to put up a foothold; when i came back to downgrade the climb, people told me to leave it as is…</p>

<p><strong>“between a wall and a hard place” v0</strong>: jugs straight up, novelty in option to use right foot smear on essentially no-tex gym wall. also a frustrating set because no wall, holds, or boltholes left.</p>
