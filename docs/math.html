<p>i am finishing my undergraduate degree in mathematics. currently, i am working on my thesis.</p>
<p>previously, i did machine learning research with organizations of varying size. if you ask nicely, i might tell you where.</p>
<p>i am taking a 2026 gap and intend to apply to phd programs in statistics and computer science after. roughly speaking, i am interested in ai security, especially with applications from pozk, adversarial methods, and probabilistic machine learning. this is broad and i intend to narrow it down… eventually</p>
<p>in the meantime, i’ll be doing research here and there + looking for some projects.</p>
