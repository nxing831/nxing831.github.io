<p>i am finishing my undergraduate degree in mathematics. currently, i am beginning my thesis in error correcting codes.</p>
<p>previously, i did research in a variety of buildings in other places.</p>
<p>i am taking a 2026 gap and intend to apply to phd programs in statistics and computer science after. roughly speaking, i am interested in ai security; this involves privacy, secure computing, adversarial machine learning, and alignment.</p>
<p>i also enjoy statistical learning theory, deep learning, etc. recently i have gone down a rabbithole on bayesian learning methods. i am also entertaining random processes and stochastic control.</p>
